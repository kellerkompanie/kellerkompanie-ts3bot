# kellerkompanie-ts3bot
This project is a automated bot for Teamspeak3 that connects the kellerkompanie backend with Teamspeak.

## Murgeye's TS3 API as submodule
Murgeye's Teamspeak3 API (https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-api) was added as a submodule, after you clone the repository you need to initialize the submodule (a.k.a. actually downloading the files):
```
cd kellerkompanie-ts3bot
git submodule update --init
```
